            Everyone can make music! Mia is passionate about creating an
            environment for you to discover your sound. Her approach to music
            lessons is holistic. She invites you to free your inner artist by
            experimenting with your breath, mind and body through vocal and
            musical exercises. From this point, Mia will guide you on the path
            of musical education that your interests take you.
          </p>
